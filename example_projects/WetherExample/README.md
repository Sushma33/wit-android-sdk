## Offline http request explained

This example app uses WIT SDK "Generic Requests Edition" meaning that
you can throw(1) any kind of data to any url of choice which can result
in a big payload being sent via SMS.
Our system take care of compressing and optimizing the request you are doing.

Here at [WIT Technology](https://www.witsdk.com) we offer a premium support to any company.
We can optimize up to 70% the speed of the requests and as a consequence the prices for the data transportation.
Your endpoints will remain the same so you don't have to modify any code to take
advantage of this.

#### [WIT SDK](https://github.com/WithoutInternetTechnology/wit-android-sdk/) supports all HTTP Requests Verbs -> get|post|put|patch|delete
